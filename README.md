This project is an assignment for the module COMP41670, a module given in UCD in which Java programming is taught.
The assignment was worth 80% of the modules final grade, and the work on the assignment is split equally amongst two students.

This design has been implemented by Demi Oke (@demioke) and Daniel McManus (@dmcmanus173).
